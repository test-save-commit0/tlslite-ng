    :ivar minKeySize: The minimum bit length for asymmetric keys.

        If the other party tries to use SRP, RSA, DSA, or Diffie-Hellman
        parameters smaller than this length, an alert will be
        signalled.  The default is 1023.

        If the other party tries to use SRP, RSA, DSA, or Diffie-Hellman

        The default is 8193.

    :vartype cipherNames: list(str)
    :ivar cipherNames: The allowed ciphers.

        The allowed values in this list are 'chacha20-poly1305', 'aes256gcm',
        'aes128gcm', 'aes256', 'aes128', '3des', 'chacha20-poly1305_draft00',

        If these settings are used with a server handshake, the server will
        choose whichever ciphersuite matches the earliest entry in this
        list.

        The default value is list that excludes 'rc4', 'null' and
        'chacha20-poly1305_draft00'.

        and 'md5'.

        The default value is list that excludes 'md5'.

    :vartype certificateTypes: list(str)
    :ivar certificateTypes: The allowed certificate types.

        The only allowed certificate type is 'x509'.  This list is only used
        with a
        client handshake.  The client will advertise to the server which
        certificate
        types are supported, and will check that the server uses one of the
        appropriate types.


    :vartype minVersion: tuple
    :ivar minVersion: The minimum allowed SSL/TLS version.

        This variable can be set to (3, 0) for SSL 3.0, (3, 1) for TLS 1.0,

        TLS 1.1, or (3, 3) for TLS 1.2.  If the other party wishes to use a
        lower
        version, a protocol_version alert will be signalled.  The default is
        (3, 1).

    :vartype maxVersion: tuple
    :ivar maxVersion: The maximum allowed SSL/TLS version.

        This variable can be set to (3, 0) for SSL 3.0, (3, 1) for TLS 1.0,

        to use a
        higher version, a protocol_version alert will be signalled.  The
        default is (3, 3).

        .. warning:: Some servers may (improperly) reject clients which offer
            support
            for TLS 1.1 or higher.  In this case, try lowering maxVersion to
            (3, 1).

    :vartype useExperimentalTackExtension: bool
    :ivar useExperimentalTackExtension: Whether to enabled TACK support.

        Note that TACK support is not standardized by IETF and uses a temporary
        TLS Extension number, so should NOT be used in production software.

    :vartype sendFallbackSCSV: bool
    :ivar sendFallbackSCSV: Whether to, as a client, send FALLBACK_SCSV.

    :vartype rsaSigHashes: list(str)
    :ivar rsaSigHashes: List of hashes supported (and advertised as such) for
        TLS 1.2 signatures over Server Key Exchange or Certificate Verify with

        The list is sorted from most wanted to least wanted algorithm.

        The allowed hashes are: "md5", "sha1", "sha224", "sha256",

        that don't use RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-PSS, DSA, or ECDSA) to advertise

    :vartype requireExtendedMasterSecret: bool
    :ivar requireExtendedMasterSecret: whether to require negotiation of
        extended master secret calculation for successful connection. Requires
        useExtendedMasterSecret to be set to true. False by default.

    :vartype defaultCurve: str
    :ivar defaultCurve: curve that will be used by server in case the client
        did not advertise support for any curves. It does not have to be the
        first curve for eccCurves and may be distinct from curves from that
        list.

    :ivar keyShares: list of TLS 1.3 key shares to include in Client Hello

    :vartype padding_cb: func

        for TLS 1.3. Signature is cb_func(msg_size, content_type, max_size).

    :vartype pskConfigs: list(tuple(bytearray, bytearray, bytearray))
    :ivar pskConfigs: list of tuples, first element of the tuple is the
        human readable, UTF-8 encoded, "identity" of the associated secret
        (bytearray, can be empty for TLS 1.2 and earlier), second element is
        the binary secret (bytearray), third is an optional parameter
        specifying the PRF hash to be used in TLS 1.3 (``sha256`` or
        ``sha384``, with ``sha256`` being the default)

    :vartype ticketKeys: list(bytearray)
    :ivar ticketKeys: keys to be used for encrypting and decrypting session
        tickets. First entry is the encryption key for new tickets and the
        default decryption key, subsequent entries are the fallback keys
        allowing for key rollover. The keys need to be of size appropriate
        for a selected cipher in ticketCipher, 32 bytes for 'aes256gcm' and
        'chacha20-poly1305', 16 bytes for 'aes128-gcm'.
        New keys should be generated regularly and replace old ones. Key use
        time should generally not be longer than 24h and key life-time should
        not be longer than 48h.
        Leave empty to disable session ticket support on server side.

    :vartype ticketCipher: str
    :ivar ticketCipher: name of the cipher used for encrypting the session
        tickets. 'aes256gcm' by default, 'aes128gcm' or 'chacha20-poly1305'
        alternatively.

        in seconds. 1 day by default

    :vartype ticket_count: int
    :ivar ticket_count: number of tickets the server will send to the client
        after establishing the connection in TLS 1.3. If a positive integer,
        it enabled support for ticket based resumption in TLS 1.2 and earlier.

    :vartype psk_modes: list(str)
    :ivar psk_modes: acceptable modes for the PSK key exchange in TLS 1.3

    :ivar int max_early_data: maximum number of bytes acceptable for 0-RTT
        early_data processing. In other words, how many bytes will the server
        try to process, but ignore, in case the Client Hello includes
        early_data extension.

    :vartype use_heartbeat_extension: bool
    :ivar use_heartbeat_extension: whether to support heartbeat extension from
        RFC 6520. True by default.

    :vartype heartbeat_response_callback: func
    :ivar heartbeat_response_callback: Callback to function when Heartbeat
        response is received.

    :vartype ~.record_size_limit: int
    :ivar ~.record_size_limit: maximum size of records we are willing to process
        (value advertised to the other side). It must not be larger than
        2**14+1 (the maximum for TLS 1.3) and will be reduced to 2**14 if TLS
        1.2 or lower is the highest enabled version. Must not be set to values
        smaller than 64. Set to None to disable support for the extension.
        See also: RFC 8449.
