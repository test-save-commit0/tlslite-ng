        For client authentication, use one of these argument
        combinations:

         - username, password (SRP)
         - certChain, privateKey (certificate)

        For server authentication, you can either rely on the
        implicit mutual authentication performed by SRP,
        or you can do certificate-based server
        authentication with one of these argument combinations:

         - x509Fingerprint

        Certificate-based server authentication is compatible with
        SRP or certificate-based client authentication.

        The constructor does not perform the TLS handshake itself, but
        simply stores these arguments for later.  The handshake is
        performed only when this class needs to connect with the
        server.  Then you should be prepared to handle TLS-specific
        exceptions.  See the client handshake functions in
        :py:class:`~tlslite.tlsconnection.TLSConnection` for details on which
        exceptions might be raised.

        :param str username: SRP username.  Requires the
            'password' argument.

        :param str password: SRP password for mutual authentication.
            Requires the 'username' argument.

        :param X509CertChain certChain: Certificate chain for client
            authentication.
            Requires the 'privateKey' argument.  Excludes the SRP arguments.

        :param RSAKey privateKey: Private key for client authentication.
            Requires the 'certChain' argument.  Excludes the SRP arguments.

        :param Checker checker: Callable object called after handshaking to
            evaluate the connection and raise an Exception if necessary.

        :type settings: HandshakeSettings
        :param settings: Various settings which can be used to control
            the ciphersuites, certificate types, and SSL/TLS versions
            offered by the client.

        :param bool anon: set to True if the negotiation should advertise only
            anonymous TLS ciphersuites. Mutually exclusive with client
            certificate
            authentication or SRP authentication

        :type host: str or None
        :param host: the hostname that the connection is made to. Can be an
            IP address (in which case the SNI extension won't be sent). Can
            include the port (in which case the port will be stripped and
            ignored).
